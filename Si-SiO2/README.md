# Si/SiO$\_2$ Interface and H Release

The structure that Blair sent is an interfacial model without (as far as I can tell) any dangling bonds. Based on Andy's suggestion, I am going to strain the cell in the $a$ and $b$ directions to match the Si lattice constant (5.43 A). The $a$ and $b$ directions are along the diagonal of a face of the Si unit cell. There are 3 atoms along the diagonal in the unit cell, with a total distance of $5.43\sqrt{2} = 7.679$ A. There are 4 atoms across the $a$ and $b$ directions of the supercell, so the $a$ and $b$ lattice constants should be 15.358 A. The strained CONTCAR with the new lattice constants is stored in `CONTCAR_strained`.
