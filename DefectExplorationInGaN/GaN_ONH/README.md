# Hydrogenated $\text{O}_{\text{N}}$ Substitutional Defect in $\text{GaN}$

We will be considering the hydrogenated oxygen substitutional defect on a nitrogen site for our first pass at the hydrogen release problem. First, I need to determine where the H prefers to sit. I set up four different H positions opposite the bonding Ga atoms. I labeled the bond directions $[-1, -1, -1]$, $[0, 0, 1]$, $[0, 1, -1]$, and $[1, -1, -1]$, based on the direction of the H relative to the O. *These planes are not right on line, but they give a clear distinction between the different positions. If we talk about them, we may want to be more precise.* For the H in the c-direction, I also set up a displaced geometry where the O is shifted as in the $DX$ center geometry seen in AlGaN. I don't expect the added H to stabilize this geometry in GaN, but I wanted to try just in case.
