# Singly hydrogenated Ga vacancy in GaN

In order to consider a singly-hydrogenated Ga vacancy, we must find a stable position for the H relative to a H far away from the defect. 

| Start Geometry | Total E (eV) |
|------|------------|
| Far away | -2176.86170177 |
| In channel near vacancy | | 
| Bonded to N | -2180.10308825 |
| Along N to N (old Ga) | -2180.10215521 |
| Bonded to Ga | -2180.08024126 |

Far away from the defect, the H ends up bonding to a N that is no longer bonded to any Ga atoms. Close to the defect, no matter what starting point I used, the H ended up on one of the N atoms with a dangling bond. This configuration seems to make sense and is straightforward for the release problem, so let's move forward with that.
