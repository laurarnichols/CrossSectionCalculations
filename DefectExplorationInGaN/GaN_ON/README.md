# $\text{GaN}$ with $\text{O}_{\text{N}}$ Substitutional Defect

We chose this defect because of its low formation energy and the ability to compare with experiment. 

First, to set up the defect, I picked a N atom (248) near the center of the cell at $(0.40000, 0.55556, 0.45865)$ to replace with an O atom, then I shifted the position of that atom by $(0.0, -0.1, 0.1)$ before relaxing.
