# Phonons

Phonon calculations are needed to get the frequency and vector displacement of each phonon mode. The phonons are calculated in the ground state at the initial positions (the algebra assumes that the frequencies do not change in the initial and final states, but the eigenvectors may be different).

Calculations follow directions laid out in [this note](https://github.com/laurarnichols/CrossSectionCalculations/blob/main/Notes/phonons.md). At one point, there was a special symmetry of the supercell, but that was not real. Make sure to look out for that and be careful of the symmetry tolerance.
