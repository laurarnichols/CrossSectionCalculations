# H Release

* Need $\Delta q$ for multiphonon. Can it just be a relaxation of the H stretch mode and/or other dominant defect modes?
* Could take the route of calculating $\Delta q$ from anharmonicity, but we have tried that route and it is very complicated.
* Could instead make a map of how much energy the H takes in to how much it will relax. 
* Two possible $\Delta q$'s: minimum to minimum if it gets over the barrier or new average position if excited anharmonic.
* How can we get the anharmonic map?
  * Ignore hits that do not give enough energy to go anharmonic
  * Move H manually to plot energy profile/barrier
  * Get H-mode quanta size from phonons
  * Map each quanta absorption to new max/min positions and a new expectation value of the position 
  * Treat the phonons as original parabola but centered at the new expectation value (Is this valid? May be needed at least as a first approximation.)
