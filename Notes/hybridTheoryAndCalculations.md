# Hybrid Theory and Calculations

## Theory
* Hybrid functionals are functionals that mix in various portions of the exact (Hartree-Fock) exchange with the exchange-correlation of other functionals (often LDA or GGA)
* The idea is that hybrid functionals can better describe properties like the band gap
* Some of the most common ones are B3LYP (chemistry) and HSE (solid state); PBE0 is also used in solid state, but most people now favor HSE
* HSE takes the form

$$ E_{\text{xc}}^{\omega \text{PBEh}} = a E_{\text{x}}^{\text{HF,SR}}(\omega) + (1 - a) E_{\text{x}}^{\text{PBE,SR}}(\omega) + E_{\text{x}}^{\text{PBE,LR}}(\omega) + E_{\text{c}}^{\text{PBE}}, $$

where $\omega$ is a screening length and $a$ is the mixing amount.
* This says that, at some short range, weâ€™ll mix the HF exchange and the PBE exchange, keeping the PBE exchange outside the screening length, and we will always use the correlation energy from the PBE functional
* In general, the HSE functional gives reasonable band gaps for a wide range of materials
* Standard reference values are $a = 0.25$ and $\omega = 0.2$. 
* Tuning the functional is changing the $a$ parameter
