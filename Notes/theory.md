# Theory

* In Si, the VBM is at gamma, but the CBM is at X point in the primitive cell
* For wurtzite cell, $a$ is along the bottom of the hexagon, $c$ is the direction perpendicular, and $u$ is the ratio of the nearest-neighbor bond length along the $c$-axis to the $c$ lattice parameter
* Threshold voltage refers roughly to where the transition between on and off is for a device
* Positive/negative shifts in the threshold voltage are indicative of negatively/positively-charged defects
* The Jahn-Teller theorem says that for electronically-degenerate states in a solid, there exists a symmetry-breaking, lower-energy state
