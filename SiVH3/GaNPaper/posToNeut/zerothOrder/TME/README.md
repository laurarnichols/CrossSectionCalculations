# Zeroth-order matrix elements

* Band parameters used:
```
 iBandIinit  = 1025         ! initial state initial band
 iBandIfinal = 1088         ! initial state final band
 iBandFinit  = 1024         ! final state initial band
 iBandFfinal = 1024         ! final state final band
```
* For gamma-point, I accidentally used 1089 as the max initial state rather than 1088, but I fixed it moving forward
* With gamma-point, used 132 processors and took 2 minutes
