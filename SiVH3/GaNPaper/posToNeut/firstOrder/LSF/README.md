# First-order LSF

Four different transition rates are included here. The unshifted one is just using the overlap for the matrix element. The other three have matrix elements that are shifted by the baseline (undisplaced) wave function overlap between the initial and final defect states for increased numerical accuracy. The `shifted` transition rate is only shifted by the baseline. The two energy-corrected transition rates have energies that are shifted to match the gap between the defect level and the conduction band in the HSE band structure. One is corrected to match the ground state (what we were originally using) and one is corrected to match the excited state (what we should actually be using).
