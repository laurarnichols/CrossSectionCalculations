# First-order LSF

Three different transition rates are included here. The unshifted one is just using the overlap for the matrix element. The other two have matrix elements that are shifted by the baseline (undisplaced) wave function overlap between the initial and final defect states for increased numerical accuracy. The energy-corrected matrix element also uses PBE energies that have been shifted to match the gap between the defect and the CBM from the HSE calculation.
