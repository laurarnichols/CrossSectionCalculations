# First-order LSF

These results are the final first-order transition rate. The matrix elements have the baseline (overlap between orthogonal, non-displaced wave functions) subtracted out. We had to go back after to correct the energies so that the gap between the defect level and the conduction band came from the initial charge state. We also made sure that all k-points were using a single reference point (a mistake that I made) and that the ficticious defect dispersion was not included.
