# First-order transition rate

The first-order term was done completely at $\Gamma$. The first-order matrix calculation is huge, so I am not including the results here. My basic approach was to start from the $\Gamma$-point wave function and charge density for the final charge state (ground state) in the initial positions. That system was the central point from which the atoms were displaced to get the displaced wave functions needed for the first-order matrix element.
