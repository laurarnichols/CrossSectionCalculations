# Final charge state, final positions

This calculation is used as a starting point for the excited-state relaxation. The relaxed geometry is also used for the phonons and the displacement for the `Sj` calculation. Only a relaxation is needed because only the geometry is used.

The calculation was originally done using a 2x2x2 supercell, but we switched to using a 4x4x4 supercell; however, I left the 2x2x2 supercell geometries (initial and final) in case they might be useful in the future.
