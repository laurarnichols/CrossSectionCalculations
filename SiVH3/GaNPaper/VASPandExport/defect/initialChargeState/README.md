# Initial charge state

The relaxed geometry from this calculation is used for the matrix elements (in initial, ground state) and the displacement for the `Sj` calculation. Only a relaxation is needed because only the geometry is used. 

* Use relaxed geometry from ground-state defect as a starting point
* WZP method used to make defect positive
* 1023 filled valence bands, empty defect state in both channels, and single carrier in CBM in spin-up channel
