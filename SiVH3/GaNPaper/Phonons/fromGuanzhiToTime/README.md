# Files from Guanzhi to Time

We are looking at trying to do a larger supercell size. My SCF calculations ran in just a couple minutes in the 2x2x2 supercell, and I know that will increase in the 4x4x4 supercell. However, Guanzhi said that his calculation in the 4x4x4 supercell ran in 85 minutes, and I can't see the calculation getting that large. He sent me his input files to see how fast it runs on the DOD supercomputer. I will also take a look at the input parameters to see if I would change anything to speed up the calculation.
