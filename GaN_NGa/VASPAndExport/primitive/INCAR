! How to initialize charge density and wave functions
ISTART = 0        ! 0 to start a new job, 1 for continuing and reading in wf
ICHARG = 2        ! 2 to start a new job, 1 for continuing and reading in chg
!INIWAV = 1        ! chooses initially random wf, numerically best

! Electronic control flags
ENCUT  = 400      ! cutoff energy
EDIFF  = 1E-6     ! convergence threshold
PREC   = Normal   ! numerical precision
ALGO   = Normal   ! Davidson algorithm, usually best choice
NELMIN = 5        ! min electronic steps
NELM   = 50       ! max electronic steps

ISPIN  = 1        ! Spin polarized calculation: 1 = No, 2 = Yes

! Parallelization flags
NCORE = 16        ! Band parallelization, 16 is good for PBE, 4 is good for HSE
KPAR  = 1         ! Set to number of k-point blocks (remember to multiply nodes/procs in jobscript)

! Ionic control flags
EDIFFG = -1E-2    ! Convergence for ionic relaxation
NSW = 300           ! Number of ionic steps per relaxation job
IBRION = 2       ! Relaxation algorithm, -1 is off, 2 is conjugate gradient
ISIF = 2          ! What to relax. 2 does just the internal DOF, 3 does the lattice vectors too

! Electronic broadening
ISMEAR = 0        ! 0 is Gaussian broadening
SIGMA  = 0.01     ! amount of broadening

LWAVE  = .TRUE.   ! write out wavefunctions
LCHARG = .TRUE.   ! write out chargedensity
LVTOT  = .FALSE.  ! write out full potential
LVHAR  = .FALSE.  ! write out electrostatic potential
