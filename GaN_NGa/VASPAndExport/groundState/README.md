# Ground state N antisite defect

I started from the [relaxed pristine supercell](../pristine/) and removed a Ga atom near the center of the cell, replaced it with a N atom, then shifted the N position slightly to break the symmetry. Going to relax and make sure that the N atom doesn't go back to the higher-symmetry position.
