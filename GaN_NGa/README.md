# GaN with $\text{N}_\text{Ga}$ antisite defect

The material we will be exploring for the H release problem is GaN with an N antisite defect. First, I will calculate the formation energy to make sure that the system we have agrees losely with the [2011 Roy paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0026271410005123) in AlGaN. Next, I will do a quick zeroth-order capture calculation to see if it makes sense and to see if there are any issues we might run into with this material. Finally, I will work with the hydrogenated defect to consider H release.
