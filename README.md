# Cross Section Calculations

This repo holds files needed for running calculations for the cross section project. Goals of this repo:
* Track changes in the problem to solve over time
* Track progress of various tasks needed to solve a given problem
* Transfer output files between devices for analysis
* Hold summary of results (not large output files) for long-term reference
* Keep relevant input files to ease recreating calculations in the future

For each independent problem,
* A new folder should be made
* A `README.md` file should be created in that directory with
  * A description of the problem
  * A task list for calculations/analysis steps that need to be done
  * Notes on undergoing the calculations, if any
  * A summary of the results
* Input files should be committed along to way to track changes
* Any analysis data like spreadsheets, plots, images, etc. should be included
