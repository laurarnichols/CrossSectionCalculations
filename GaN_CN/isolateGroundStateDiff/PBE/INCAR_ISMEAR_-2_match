! How to initialize charge density and wave functions
ISTART = 0        ! 0 to start a new job, 1 for continuing and reading in wf
ICHARG = 2        ! 2 to start a new job, 1 for continuing and reading in chg
INIWAV = 1        ! chooses initially random wf, numerically best

! Electronic control flags
ENCUT   = 400 !517      ! cutoff energy
EDIFF   = 1E-6     ! convergence threshold
PREC    = Normal   ! numerical precision
PRECFOCK = Fast   ! Controls FFT grid in exact exchange routines
ALGO    = Damped   ! Davidson algorithm, usually best choice
TIME    = 0.2      ! Time step for damped algorithm
LDIAG   = .TRUE.  ! Keep original orbital order
NELMIN  = 5        ! min electronic steps
NELM    = 80       ! max electronic steps
LMAXMIX = 4        ! For d electrons
AMIX    = 0.1      ! For numerical stability
BMIX    = 0.01     ! For numerical stability

!ISYM    = -1       ! Turn off symmetry
ISPIN  = 2        ! Spin polarized calculation: 1 = No, 2 = Yes

! Parallelization flags
NCORE = 11        ! Band parallelization, 16 is good for PBE, 4 is good for HSE
KPAR  = 1         ! Set to number of k-point blocks (remember to multiply nodes/procs in jobscript)

! Ionic control flags
NSW = 0         ! Number of ionic steps per relaxation job
IBRION = -1        ! Relaxation algorithm, -1 is off, 2 is conjugate gradient

! Electronic broadening
NBANDS = 568      ! Number of bands, based on OUTCAR from ground state
ISMEAR = -2       ! -2 is to manually set occupations
FERWE = 432*1 136*0 ! All valence band filled and electron in defect level
FERDO = 431*1 137*0 ! All valence band filled but top

LWAVE  = .TRUE.   ! write out wavefunctions
LCHARG = .TRUE.   ! write out chargedensity
LVTOT  = .FALSE.  ! write out full potential
LVHAR  = .FALSE.  ! write out electrostatic potential
