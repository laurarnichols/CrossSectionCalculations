# `SiVH3_convergence`

This set of calculations is meant to test the convergence on the original Barmparis electronic matrix elements. Everything used in these input files is the same as in the paper calculations except the wave-function and charge-density cutoffs. The system is a triply-hydrogenated silicon vacancy, and PBE functionals are used.
